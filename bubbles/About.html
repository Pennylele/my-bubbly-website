  <div class="container">
  <h4 class="para02">Hey there! If you you are reading this page, you probably mean to learn something about me. I want to tell you four things about myself — my name, my passion, my dream job, and my personality(No worries, it wouldn’t be that long).
  <div class="Penny"><img src="Penny.jpg" width="300" height="500"style="border-radius:20px"></div></h4>
  
  <h4 class="para02">My Chinese <span style="color: #ffd97e">name</span> is Le Fang, but I would love people to call me Penny, as I have developed great attachment to this name. Thanks to the Big Bang Theory! (Hope you have watched it, it’s fun.)</h4>

  <h4 class="para02">Different from that Penny in the Big Bang Theory, my <span style="color: #ffd97e">passion</span> lies in localization, technology, and languages. As a linguist, I have earned my MA TESOL degree in Michigan State University and have two-year Chinese teaching experience to both college students and 5-year-old kids. I am also earning my translation and localization management degree at Middlebury Institute of International Studies, which prepares me to be a localization professional. I am so excited that I am graduating this May and will be able to put what I have learned in school into practice.</h4>

  <h4 class="para02">My <span style="color: #ffd97e">dream job</span> is localization engineering and localization project management(especially in the area of software and website localization). As I have been exposing myself to HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, I am super interested in front-end web development. I am starting to try to build my own simple newbie website project.</h4>
  
	<h4 class="para02">For my <span style="color: #ffd97e">personal traits</span>, I am always excited to learn new skills and knowledge. I am not afraid of being exhausted, as long as I can learn new stuff. My goal is to enrich myself with all different knowledge and become a tech geek!</h4>
	<h4 class="para02">After reading this you may have known something about me…and yes you are right! I am wearing a big pair of glasses!
